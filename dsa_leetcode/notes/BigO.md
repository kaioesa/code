# Big O

Is about scale, not performance it self.

    Log N -> exponentially increase the load, but increase the iterations needed linearly.
        - For example, in a binary search algorithm:
        - Log(10) -> 3.32 -> array with 10 itens takes 3 iterations to find the target
        - Log(20) -> 4.32 -> array with 20 itens takes 4 iterations to find the target

    N -> linearly.
