# Data Structures

Data structures (ordered by level of importance, first is more important):
    More common DS --> More specific study: Changes to the algoritm, edge cases, additional follow-ups, etc.
        - Strings
        - Arrays
        - Hashmaps
        Respective solving patterns:
            - Greedy
            - Binary Search
            - Two Pointers
            - Sliding window
            - Backtracking

    Less commom
        - Trees
        - Matrix
        - Priority Queue
        Respective solving patterns:
            - Breadth-First-Search (BFS)
            - Depth-First-Search (DFS)
            - Recursion

    Rare
        - Graph
        - Stack
        - Trie
        - Linked List
        Respective solving patterns:
            - Dynamic Programming (DP)
            - Monotonic Stack
            - Union Find
