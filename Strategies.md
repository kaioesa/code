# Strategies

## Steps

- Repeat the problem -> rubber duck
- Asking clarifying questions -> it's okay if I do this X thing?
- Work through examples -> does X, Y, Z data outputs A, B C?
- Brainstorm multiple solutions -> have a naive / brute force solution, THEN develop a more optimal ones (best space complexity, fastest one, etc.)
- Implement the code -> know the common functions, write correct syntax, write your thoughts into code
- Test the code -> debug the code, search for syntax failures, logic failures.

## Thinking stage

- Understand the problem. Repeat the problem, formulate questions about the challenge.
  - Questions must be:
    - relevant about the challenge: its okay if I write some annotations?
    - clarifying the problem ou a certain thing: do i need to order any data before?

- Stablish a strategy to solve a DSA problem.

## Building some good problem solving

- The best way to do it is looking from the past (persisting something with a HashSet, HashMap, etc.) or looking at the future (iterating)?
- Can I solve it with two pointers explicitly declared or can I calculate the period / fix window.
- Be careful with using a hammer instead of a knife, using a data structure to validate a sum, for example, we really needed this? Do we need to get all sums or we can just save the max result to a variable?
